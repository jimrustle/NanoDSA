# NanoDSA
small-sized acceptable performance dynamic signal analyzer


# yes this is inspired from the EEVBlog thread

no guarantees anything works out

- AD4003 + OPA828 (maxwell3e10 on eevblog)
- DAC for freq. response (as tracking gen?) and distortion measurements (Berni on eevblog)
- probably ST micro since they're my favorite

# design parameters

- DC to 1 MHz, ~100 db SNR
- 4096 points FFT
- screen? (3-inch or 5-inch TFT LCD using SPI bus?)
- usb-to-computer support like in nanovna?
